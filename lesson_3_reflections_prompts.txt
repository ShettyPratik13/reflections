When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-We would want to create a remote repository when we wamt to share our work and make it open to editing.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
-We would prefer to pull changes manually as we would not always want our local repository to be a clone of the remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
-Forking is used to copy someone else's repository on GitHub to your account on GitHub. Cloning can be used to clone from remote to local, or local to local. 
Branching is used to create a new branch to work on an experimental feature.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
-The benefit in this is that you have all the changes/branches on the local repository it order to compare when needed, even when there is no internet access.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
-Collaborating without Git or GitHub would be difficult. Git and GitHub make version control, managing and sharing changes to projects easy.
